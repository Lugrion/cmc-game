## 🚀 **Features**
- **Three unique characters**, each with their own strengths and weaknesses:
  1. **Core** – Light and fast but has weak attacks.
  2. **Mantle** – Strong and durable but slow in movement.
  3. **Crust** – A well-balanced fighter with average stats.
- **Factory Method Pattern** for scalable and maintainable game object creation.
- Smooth gameplay with **PhaserJS** for rendering and interaction.
- **TypeScript** ensures type-safe code and cleaner development practices.

## 🎮 **How to Play**
1. **Choose your fighter**:
   - **Core**: A fast and agile character but deals low damage.
   - **Mantle**: A tank with high strength but slower speed.
   - **Crust**: Balanced in all aspects, perfect for all-around gameplay.

2. **Control your character** to move and attack
3. **Master the timing** of each fighter to optimize your playstyle.
